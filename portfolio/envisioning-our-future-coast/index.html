					<p><em>Envisioning Our Future Coast</em> is a storytelling website with the purpose of awareness and education about the future of Louisiana's disappearing coastline. It's a project of the Walton Family Foundation with support from Restore the Mississippi River Delta coalition. The website is based on WFF fellow Dr. Donald Boesch's groundbreaking report about the prospect of a smaller, yet productive coast in the decades to come. This website tells one aspect of a much bigger story surrounding climate change, disappearing land, and coastal restoration.</p>

					<p>Due to the complexity of the content, and the story we needed to tell, an initial storyboard was created to map out the flow from beginning to end. Our goal was to keep the user interested without bogging them down with overly-scientific information and long sections of content.</p>

					<p>Once the storyboard was finalized, we began the design. My vision for the website was inspired by the unique style of storytelling/awareness campaign websites. Dark, moody backgrounds with slow transitions allowed us to control the pace for users and create an immersive experience. Large, colorful imagery and video clips of dramatic landscapes, wildlife, community, and culture bring the story to life and keeps the user engaged. Bright neon colors and strong typography express an urgent, "take action" attitude.</p>

					<p>The website can be divided into three main parts: 1) The issue Louisiana is currently facing with coastal land loss as a result of man-made actions over the past century, and the actions that need to be taken to stave off further erosion; 2) The six major basins that make up south Louisiana, their importance, and the restoration efforts are taking place; and 3) What the user can do/take away from this. This website is unique from other sites I've done in that there isn't really a final call-to-action or conversion goal. It's purely a resource for knowledge and understanding of what's going on and what could be.</p>
