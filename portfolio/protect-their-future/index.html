						<p><em>Restore the Coast. Protect their Future.</em> was a commercial and digital campaign that ran during Superbowl LIII in early 2019. I designed this book as a "report" of that campaign that tells the story behind the commercial production and the results of the audience's reception. This book serves as an awareness and promotional tool that was handed out to policymakers and legislators.</p>

					<p>The report begins with background information about Louisiana's land loss crisis and how the coast is a vital source for the people, wildlife, and economy of the state. The core message of the report implores the rate that land loss is currently happening threatens the future of Louisiana's coast for its children and grandchildren who call this place home.</p>

					<p>Next, the report dives into the commercial production of the campaign inluding the script, filming locations, and the kids  who starred in the ad. Sprinkled throughout the report are comments received from people in all areas of Louisiana who responded to the campaign at <a href="http://restorethecoast.org" target="_blank">RestoreTheCoast.org</a></p>

					<p>In early 2019, we ran a digital campaign through news outlets and Google display advertising. The creative was split into two target audiences: Parents and Voters. The Parent creative focused on children while the Voter creative focused on land loss. Both end with a CTA to submit a response on the campaign website.</p>
