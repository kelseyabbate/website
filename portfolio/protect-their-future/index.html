					<p>"Restore the Coast. Protect their Future." was a commercial and digital campaign that aired during Superbowl LIII in early 2019. This book is a "report" of that campaign that tells the story behind the campaign, the commercial production, and the results of the target audience's reception.</p>

					<p>The report begins with some background information about Louisiana's land loss crisis and how the coast is a vital source for the people, wildlife, and economy of the state. The rate this land loss is currently happening is threatning the future of Louisiana's coast for our children and grandchildren who call this place home.</p>

					<p>Next, the report dives into the commercial production of the campaign inluding the script, filming locations, and the kids  who starred in the ad. Sprinkled throughout the report are comments received from people in all areas of Louisiana who responded to the campaign at <a href="http://restorethecoast.org" target="_blank">RestoreTheCoast.org</a></p>

					<p>In early 2019, we ran a digital retargeting campaign through news outlets and Google display advertising. The creative was split into two target audiences: Parents and Voters. The Parents creative focused on children while the Voters creative focused on land loss. Both end with a call to action to submit a response on the campaign website.</p>
