					<p>I'm an award-winning Senior Designer and UX Strategist in New Orleans, Louisiana with 7+ years of experience in a fast-paced creative and interactive agency. My background in graphic design and web development allows me to work on multifaceted projects that include branding, print, and digital solutions.</p>
					<p>As a Senior Designer, I primarily focus on branding, website design, advertising, and layouts. I've created logos, posters, brochures, signage, reports &amp; books, and a variety of large and small websites. I strive to create beautiful and simplistic design solutions that effectively get the message across. I enjoy playing with negative space and finding the right typeface pairings.</p>
					<p>As a UX Strategist, I use my knowledge of web development to inform how I design a website to make it not only beautiful but functional and easy for the user. I ensure that there is a cohesive, branded look across print and web platforms. I also act as a "design liason" between the creative and development teams. When a website design goes into development, I help to guide the developers with design decisions and make sure the website's look and feel is carried throughout the entire website.</p>
					<p>I was born and raised near Detroit, Michigan and moved to New Orleans in 2011. I received my Bachelor of Fine Arts from Michigan State University with concentrations in Graphic Design and Printmaking. On the weekends, I enjoy yoga and running at the park.</p>
