					<h3>Restore the Coast. Protect their Future. was a commercial and digital campaign that ran during Superbowl LIII in early 2019. I designed this book as a report of that campaign that tells the story behind the work and the audience's reception. This book serves as an awareness and promotional piece that was given to policymakers and legislators.</h3>

					<h3>The report begins with Louisiana's land loss crisis and explains the importance of the coast as a vital source for the people, wildlife, and economy of the state. The core message implores that the current rate of land loss threatens the future of Louisiana's coast for its children and grandchildren who call this place home.</h3>

The Parent creative focused on children while the Voter creative focused on land loss. Both end with a CTA to submit a response on the campaign website.</h3>
